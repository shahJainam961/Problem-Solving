// Problem Statement

// Let there be N workers and N jobs. Any worker can be assigned to perform any job, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the work-job assignment. It is required to perform all jobs by assigning exactly one worker to each job and exactly one job to each agent in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.

// Input Format
// Number of workers and job: N
// Cost matrix C with dimension N*N where C(i,j) is the cost incurred on assigning ith Person to jth Job.

// Sample Input
// 4

// [
// 9 2 7 8
// 6 4 3 7
// 5 8 1 8
// 7 6 9 4
// ]

// Sample Output
// 13

// Constraints
// N <= 20
